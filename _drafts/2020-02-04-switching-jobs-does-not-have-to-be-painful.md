It will be two years since I left my previous job and it's time to do it again.   For a 'management' role, two years seems to be short and comes up with lots of noise, questions and office stress, but it does not have to be that way.

The longest time I've stayed at a job is exactly 748 days, with the exception of [Banshai](http://www.banshai.com) For a formal job, this is the longest time I have been at a company that is not mine.
