After two years, today is my last day here.  I joined back in March 2018 to lead the Mobile Discipline and later on became Head of Development for the Bogotá Delivery Unit.

As in any other job, there were ups and downs, difficult conversations, decisions <!--more-->and problems to solve but also a great number of learning opportunities, challenges, and a handful of new friends.

Thank you to the ones that supported me with the cool things, to the ones that challenged me, and were always straightforward and direct, and thank you all for teaching me something every day.

It's been a great ride.
