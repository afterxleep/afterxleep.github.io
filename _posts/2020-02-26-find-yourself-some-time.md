There is nothing better than giving yourself time not to do anything so that you can do a bunch of things without obligation.

In the past week, I have read two books, updated two apps, started with a new idea, learned about SwiftUI, wrote two articles,<!--more--> picked up my mountain bike again, reconnected with my family and friends, rewrote my CV, slept for 16 hours straight and ate and sleep whenever I felt like it.  

I've done a lot of things, but for some reason, don't feel tired, stressed, or overwhelmed at all.  I guess sometimes we forget that a good vacation does not always mean Netflix, the beach, or uploading leisure photos to Instagram.  

Go ahead, find yourself some guilt-free time, and commit to skipping the compromises, obligations, and urgency of life.  Just do whatever comes to mind.  I promise you will not regret it.
