Soon after I left my job in March, the pandemic exploded, and I found myself looking for something new when nobody was hiring.  Things went to a halt, and many companies stopped hiring, but although the entire industry slowed down in Colombia (where I live), there were still plenty of exciting opportunities abroad.<!--more-->

Thanks to Elena (my wife), who supported me (both financially and in the process), and the fact that we have no kids and little debt, I was able to approach things calmly and sit down at home for more than six months looking for the right opportunity.  (Lucky guy, huh?)

In the past few years, I worked in different management positions on IT services and led teams of all sizes and shapes. I'm good at it and enjoy it, but things started to get a little repetitive after some time.

Over the past 4 four years, I worked with people from all over the world, across different industries and markets, in projects that were either short-term (3 to 6 months) or staff augmentation gigs, as you usually see in the services industry.   These were not product companies, but money-making machines, writing software for the top buyer. (Not saying that is bad, at all).

The thing is, when working on IT services, you rarely get engaged with product development on a long term vision.  Clients hire you either to execute a project or to augment their internal team.  It all boils down to "Table Turnover" (You want customers to sit down, eat, pay and move along so that you can serve more), or "Fast Growth " (Put more people to work for others and sell their time).

It was a lot of fun, mostly because I met great people along the way, but at some point, I've found myself solving the same problems over and over for different clients. It all became a little dull, and I left.

For the next job, I wanted a change, and had a list of requirements (which evolved a little over time):

* Work at a product company with a long term vision/strategy.
* Autonomy to innovate and make things better.
* Work with smart people and learn from them.
* Join a company with values, ethics, and a purpose (Not everything is about money)
* 25m commute to work, or work from home.
* Work on mobile, and be a little more closer to the code.

With those in mind, I applied to more than 200 positions worldwide, hearing back from less than 20% and engaging in real conversations with about a dozen companies.

When I mention those numbers, people imagine that I opened LinkedIn and clicked "Easy Apply" on every job post. Still, in reality, I reviewed thousands of job posts, skipped most of the "Easy Apply" ones and those coming from recruitment agencies, applying only to positions I'd like to take.  It was challenging work.

There were almost no exciting opportunities in Colombia, so 98% of the applications I sent were for jobs abroad, requiring VISA sponsorship, all in the middle of the pandemic with the world on a travel ban.  Looking back, it was a very long shot.

Still, I interviewed with companies in Germany, Canada, Spain, the U.S., and the Netherlands.  Some conversations went sideways, but a few went well, and I advanced to the last steps of the process but decided not to join.   Even if those were great opportunities, I was not 100% convinced somehow.

What's most ironic is that I did not find about [Automattic](https://automattic.com) open positions on LinkedIn.  Instead,  I was reading about "unconscious bias during hiring," and after a couple of clicks, I ended up in the [How we Hire Developers](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers/) page at their site.

I know Automattic since my early days as a Web Developer.  Besides developing [WordPress](http://wordpress.com), they are the company behind [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) and [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) (among others), have been in business for 15+ years, and changed the web along the way. It's a fully remote shop, with 1000+ people spread across 70+ countries relying on its people to make things better while giving them the autonomy and tools to do so.

After applying and going through the initial interview and sending a code challenge, I got the chance to work on a 40hrs paid project that allowed both (Automattic and me) to have a glimpse of how things would be if I joined.  Thankfully it went well, and I received an offer by the end of it.

[The hiring process](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers/) is demanding and requires lots of work and commitment, but it was also a great learning opportunity, full of pleasant surprises.  It has been, by far, the most bizarre, exciting, and joyful process I have ever participated in.

I will be joining Automattic as a Mobile Engineer in the Tumblr iOS Core team.  Going back to coding full time will be a challenge, mainly because these guys are incredibly good at it, and I'm a little old and rusty, but life's boring when things are easy anyway, so bring it on!.

**EDIT:**  Many people have asked me about the process in detail, so I'll try to follow up with another post on this, although there's plenty of info about it around the web.  (Be warned, it might say the same)
