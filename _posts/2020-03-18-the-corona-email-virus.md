Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the US, I'm getting a bunch of emails about what you as CXOs are doing in your companies to "save the world from the pandemic," but honestly, I don't care.

As long as you and your companies are protecting your people and working proactively to mitigate the impact, I don't care. If you want to donate money, support research, or give your services for free, go ahead, but don't try to take advantage of the situation to promote your services or products. That is unethical marketing.

So no, I don't want to attend your webinar about working from home, buy that book you wrote ten years ago, use your conferencing service, or read the same thing over and over.

We all have too many things to worry about these days, so if you want to help, shut up and do something.  Otherwise, you are just adding more noise.
