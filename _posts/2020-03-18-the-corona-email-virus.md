Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the US, I'm getting a bunch of emails telling me about what you as CXO's are doing in your companies to "save the world," but honestly, I don't give a fuck.

As long as you and your companies are protecting the people and working proactively to prevent<!--more--> disruption of your services, I don't care.   If you want to donate money or give your services for free, go ahead, but don't use that crap for promotion. That is shitty marketing.

So no, I don't want to attend your fucking webinar about working from home, buy the book, use your service, or read the same shit over and over.  We all have too many things to worry about these days, and you are just adding more noise.
