**Hi, I'm Daniel Bernal**

I have been writing software since the late 90s and after the iPhone launch in 2007 I fell in love with the platform.  Since then I've been writing iOS apps.

During the day, I lead the Development Team at [Endava](http://www.endava.com), Bogot√°, and enjoy Mountain Biking, coffee and ocasionally speaking at conferences.

I'm always available at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/afterxleep), and frequently pushing bits to one of my [Github projects](http://github.com/afterxleep).

For more serious stuff, you can always find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/danielbernalm) or email at <a href="#">yo@this_website_url.</a>
