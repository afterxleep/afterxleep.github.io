**Hi, I'm Daniel Bernal**

I have been writing software since the late 90s and after the iPhone launch in 2007 I fell in love with the platform.  Since then I've been writing iOS apps most of the time.

During the day, I consult as Product & Development Director for <i>Appetit</i>, a startup that I founded in 2017 and go out for mid-day Mountain Bike rides, and at night, I take on cool mobile freelance gigs.

I'm always available at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/afterxleep), and frequently pushing bits to one of my [Github projects](http://github.com/afterxleep).

For more serious stuff, you can always find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/danielbernalm) or email at <a href="#">yo@this_website_url.</a>
